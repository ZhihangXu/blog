### 1. Split Gibbs Sampling (SGS)

**Goal:** Sample the posterior $p(x|y) \propto p(y|x)p(x) = \exp(-f(x;y) - g(x))$, where $f(x;y) = -\log p(y|x)$ and $g(x) = -\log p(x)$. 

Instead of direct posterior sampling, SGS samples the **auxiliary distribution**:

$$
\pi^{XZ}(x,z) \propto \exp\left( -f(z;y) - g(x) - \frac{1}{2\rho^2} \| x-z\|_2^2 \right)
$$

where $z$ is an auxiliary variable and $\rho$ is a parameter that controls the distance between $x$ and $z$. 

The SGS algorithm is achieved by alternating between the following two steps:

1.  **The likelihood step:** Given $x^{(k)}$, sample 
    $$z^{(k)} \sim \exp\left( -f(z;y) - \frac{1}{2\rho^2}\| x^{(k)}-z\|_2^2 \right)$$
2.  **The prior step:** Given $z^{(k)}$, sample 
    $$x^{(k+1)} \sim \exp\left( -g(x) - \frac{1}{2\rho^2}\| x - z^{(k)}\|_2^2 \right)$$

Essentially, these two steps are very similar to **Plug-and-Play (PnP)** methods.
