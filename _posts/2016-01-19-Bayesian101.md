1. Split Gibbs Sampling, SGS
Goal:  the posterior $p(x|y)\propto p(y|x_)p(x) = \exp(-f(x;y) - g(x))$, where $f(x;y) = - \log p(y|x)$ and $g(x) = -log p(x)$. Instead of direct posterior sampling, SGS samples the **auxiliary distribution**:
$$
\pi^{XZ}(x,z) \propto \exp(-f(z;y) - g(x) - \frac{1}{2\rho^2} \| x-z\|_2^2\,,
$$
where $z$ is an auxiliary variable and $\rho$ is a parameter that controls the distance between $x$ and $z$. The SGS algorithm is achieved by alternating between the following two steps:
1) the likelihood step: given $x^{(k)}$, sample $z^{(k)}\propto (-f(z;y) - \frac{1}{2\rho^2}\| x^{(k)}-z\|_2^2)\,,$
2) the prior step: sample $x^{(k+1}\propto \exp(-g(x) - \frac{1}{2\rho^2}\| x - z^{(k)}\|_2^2)$

Essentially, these two steps are very similar with PnP.
